This directory contains code for compiling the faststack engine into a raw
operating system with a minimal kernel.

## Installation

You will need an i686 cross-compiler such as `i686-elf-gcc` and associated
binutils. You will also want `qemu` and your distributions extended architecture
package for i386 support.

```
make run
```
