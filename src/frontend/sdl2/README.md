# FastStack-SDL

This is built atop the SDL2 library. This is a popular cross-platform library
for abstracted access to the hardware. This version should run on all major
platforms.

This is considered the primary version, since most people want a GUI interface
for playing. This will probably never be fully featured, and configuration settings
will still be drawn from an external INI file, for example.

## Dependencies

We require the core SDL2 library, and the extension libraries for truetype fonts.

### Ubuntu
```
apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0
```
